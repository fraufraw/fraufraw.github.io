I"Ã<p><em>â€œFighting game is something so great.â€  - Tokido</em></p>

<p>Games from <em>SNK</em>, <em>Capcom</em>, <em>Arc System Works</em>, <em>Bamco</em>, <em>NRS</em>, you name it. 
Iâ€™ve watched the Sun set on the arcade scene, witnessed the hypest moments in FGC, and letâ€™s not forget the funny rivalry; for over 15 years,
the highs and lows of this genre also dearly represent me, and the new chapters going forward are surely exciting.</p>
