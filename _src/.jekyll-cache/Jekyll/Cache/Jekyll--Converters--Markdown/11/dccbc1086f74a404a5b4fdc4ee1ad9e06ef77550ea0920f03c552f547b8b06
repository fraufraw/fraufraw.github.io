I"`<p>Throughout my involvement with different team projects in the past, I’m mostly known for my leadership skill.
My attention to agenda/deadline and care for the group’s unity have served as the backbone for my teams. 
I value both failure and success in a group setting.
As a teammate, I contribute silently and mediate conflicts accordingly.</p>
