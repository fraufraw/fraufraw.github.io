I"¥<p>Implemented an <em>AsciiMath to LaTeX</em> interpretor using <a href="https://www.antlr.org/">ANTLR</a>.
This project was part of the course <em>lexical and syntaxical analysis</em> in my INSA Masters program.</p>

<p>AsciiMath is a markup language that represents a subset of mathematical expressions using
simple readable ASCII syntax unlike LaTeX or MathJax.
AsciiMath is to TeX Math what Markdown is to LaTeX.</p>
