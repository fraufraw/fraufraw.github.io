    *"Fighting game is something so great."  - Tokido*
     
    Games from *SNK*, *Capcom*, *Arc System Works*, *Bamco*, *NRS*, you name it. 
    I've watched the Sun set on the arcade scene, witnessed the hypest moments in FGC, and let's not forget the funny rivalry; for over 15 years,
    the highs and lows of this genre also dearly represent me, and the new chapters going forward are surely exciting.

- head: I love tabletop games
  body: |
    From a simple game of *Mahjong* to seven long hours of *Twilight Imperium*, these games enrich my mind like no other.
    Whether it's by getting creative with strategies, reading opponents carefully, or remembering a simple rule,
    I can always find unique challenges in tabletop gaming.

- head: I'm a team player
  body: |
    Throughout my involvement with different team projects in the past, I'm mostly known for my leadership skill.
    My attention to agenda/deadline and care for the group's unity have served as the backbone for my teams. 
    I value both failure and success in a group setting.
    As a teammate, I contribute silently and mediate conflicts accordingly.

- head: I speak two languages fluently
  body: |
    I was born and raised in Taiwan, so I can speak Mandarin and read Chinese fluently; however, I've been in the States 
    for longer now, so I also consider my English to be native.

- head: I love design and theorycrafting
  body: |
    I often explore existing concepts to reinforce and design new ideas, and 
    theorycrafting is a way for me to escape from conventional gaming. Not only it helps me as a player
    to come up with with new stratedgy, but as a designer it helps me to break down (or sometimes actually break) a game to examine its innerworkings.
    
- head: I like programming
  body: |
    Programming is great tool for me to realize new ideas and experiement different solutions. It constantly reminds me of the time when I picked up
    Lego pieces as a kid to shape and build my wildest dreams.
