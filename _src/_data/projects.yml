    Research project exploring the domain of *Music Information Retrieval*
    and *Automatic Music Transcription*.

    Studied algorithms of single and multiple pitch estimation
    and onset detection.
    Provided a Python API for these algorithms using own implementation
    and/or external libraries.

  pdf: book.pdf
  description: |
    Studied and implemented active contour models for parametric curve and level-set curves,
    evolving the curves by minimizing the mean-curvature or the geodesic metric.
    A medical image is segmented using the proposed algorithms and their performance is compared.
    
    The project is based on [Numerical Tours (G. Peyré)](https://www.numerical-tours.com/)
    which explores image processing among other data science and applied mathematics topics.

  description: |
    Studied Multi-Agent Systems as part of my Masters program, with focus on
    the **belief-desire-intention** model that was applied in two mini-projects.

    Implemented *capture the flag* game using [jason](http://jason.sourceforge.net/wp/)
    as a basic BDI-model application. Also built a simulation of the propagation of the flu
    in a city using [GAMA](https://gama-platform.github.io/) modeling environment.

    Studied **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning** in the framework
    of Game Theory by extensively analysing a scientific paper and comparing it
    with more recent litterature.

    Implemented the famous sliding tiles game in Prolog using A* graph search algorithm
    for N×M sized puzzles.

    Implemented also a greedy algorithm and Iterative Deepening Depth-First-Search,
    and compared the performance and results of the algorithms.

    Implemented an *AsciiMath to LaTeX* interpretor using [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org/).
    This project was part of the course *lexical and syntaxical analysis* in my INSA Masters program.

    AsciiMath is a markup language that represents a subset of mathematical expressions using
    simple readable ASCII syntax unlike LaTeX or MathJax.
    AsciiMath is to TeX Math what Markdown is to LaTeX.

  long_title: Floating-point Arithmatics
  date: April 2016
  description: |
    Implemented mathematical operations for floating-point numbers (IEEE 765 standard)
    through bitwise operations in C++ using Newton's Algorithm, CORDIC and others.
    
    Having learned the floating numbers machine representation and implemented
    the square root function as an assignment for a course in computer-based calculations,
    I was compelled to extend the assignment to other mathematical operations.
